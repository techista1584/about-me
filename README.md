Greetings, I am Bhie 😁. Recently, I embarked on a new journey, transitioning my career towards the captivating world of coding. My fascination with programming was ignited while working with VBA language, which I utilized to automate repetitive tasks in my professional environment.

I hold degrees in Engineering and Data Analytics, and I am currently immersing myself in the comprehensive study of full-stack development. The thrill of seeing my code execute flawlessly and yield the anticipated results is a feeling of satisfaction I continually strive for. Welcome to my GitHub page.
